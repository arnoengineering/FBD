Re: {title}

I am hoping that you would consider employing me for the summer. Having just finished my {term[0]} academic term in 
Mechanical Engineering, I am an enthusiastic, motivated student with lots to offer. 

Engineering and all its branches intrigue me, but I love the mechanics of machines the most.  
Having grown up in rural Alberta, I have spent countless hours in the garage, working on my dirtbike, or the quad. 
Thus I have learnt some things about machinery. 

I have just completed the course on SolidWorks, and have done my own projects using it. Actually, 
I spend a lot of my free time in this program, designing new ideas and personal projects. I have built numerous software 
applications for aiding in my school and social life. My projects include both software and physical integration. 
I am trying different things with the 3D printer.

My computer skills are good, and Iâ€™m very comfortable working with Excel and Word. I love data, and spreadsheets, 
and flowsheets. I am also fluent in Python, with a basic knowledge in C++. I have had ample time working with 
Raspberry Pi/ Arduino - with multiple projects in each.

Finally, I am willing and excited to learn new techniques and get hands-on experience. Considering my project 
background, I think I will be an excellent addition to your team at Benchmark.

Yours sincerely,
{self.sig}
